                <h1 class="title_main">Another day in paradise</p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">by Phil Collins</p>
                <p>
                    She calls out to the man on the street
                    "Sir, can you help me?
                    It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
                    Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    He walks on, doesn't look back
                    He pretends he can't hear her
                    Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
                    Seems embarrassed to be there
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
                    Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you
                    You and me in paradise
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think about it
                </p>
                <p>
                    She calls out to the man on the street
                    He can see she's been crying
                    She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
                    She can't walk but she's trying
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
                    Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
                    You and me in paradise
                </p>
                <p>
                        Just think about it
                </p>
